Color palettes inspired by documentaries narrated by Sir David Attenborough. 

**Polar:**  
A subdued, serene palette that echoes the delicate yet harsh beauty of polar ecosystems. The soft grays, muted blues, and gentle earth tones evoke expansive ice sheets, rocky shores, and the resilience of life adapted to extreme cold. It is ideal for visualizations that require  subtle contrasts.

**LifeOfBirds:**  
An expressive and vibrant palette captures the exuberant diversity of birds. Rich greens, fiery reds, vivid blues, and sunny yellows symbolize the colorful plumage, habitats, and dynamic behaviors of avian life. 

**Leopards:**  
A homage to my favorite animal. A sophisticated and earthy palette inspired by the stealth, power, and camouflage of leopards. Featuring deep browns, sandy hues, and subtle neutrals, these colors mirror the animal’s elusive nature and the dappled environments they inhabit. 

**Oceans:**  
An inviting aquatic palette inspired by the vast, mysterious underwater world. Cool turquoises, deep blues, and sandy neutrals represent ocean depths, coral reefs, and coastal landscapes, capturing both tranquility and movement. 

**Tropical:**  
A lush, earthy palette reflects tropical rainforests' dense greenery and vibrant biodiversity. Deep greens, muted yellows, and earthy browns suggest the complexity of life within these richly layered ecosystems. 

**Tundra:**  
A crisp, minimalist palette captures the stark yet beautiful tundra biome. Cool, neutral shades accented with darker, earthy tones mirror tundra landscapes marked by sparse vegetation, rocky expanses, and long winters. This palette is effective for visuals conveying quiet strength, endurance, and subtlety.

**Titans:**  
A bold, dramatic palette inspired by the giants of the natural world—whales, elephants, and other iconic megafauna. Deep oceanic blues, strong earthy browns, and subtle grays highlight the power, majesty, and gravitas of these incredible creatures.
